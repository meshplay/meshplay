[Meshplay Catalog](https://meshplay.khulnasofy.com/catalog) functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, discovering, and sharing configurations and patterns for cloud native infrastructure. With Meshplay Catalog, you can easily find and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and tools, making it easy to streamline your cloud native development and operations processes. A Catolog is based on the Meshplay's [Catalog Schema](https://github.com/meshplay/schemas/blob/master/openapi/schemas/catalog.yml) with defined attributes.

### Simplify Your Cloud Native Infrastructure Deployment and Management

Meshplay Catalog functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, discovering, and sharing configurations and patterns for cloud native infrastructure. With Meshplay Catalog, you can easily find and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and tools, making it easy to streamline your cloud native development and operations processes.

It also supports a collaborative environment, where DevOps engineers can share their experiences, feedback, and best practices with others in the community. Import cloud native patterns published by others into your Meshplay Server. Benefit from and build upon each pattern by incorporating your own tips and tricks, then publish and share with the community at-large. This facilitates knowledge-sharing and helps to build a strong ecosystem of cloud native infrastructure experts.

4. Follow the prompts or instructions provided by the Meshplay CLI help.
* Apply [design file](https://docs.meshplay.khulnasofy.com/guides/configuration-management):  `meshplayctl design apply --file [path to design file | URL of the file]`
* Delete design file:  `meshplayctl design delete --file [path to design file]`
* View design file:  `meshplayctl design view [design name | ID]`
* List all designs: `meshplayctl design list`
5. [Importing](https://docs.meshplay.khulnasofy.com/reference/meshplayctl#cloud-native-pattern-configuration-and-management) a design. `meshplayctl design import -f [file-path] -s [manifest | compose | helm]`
6. Applying [WASM Filter](https://docs.meshplay.khulnasofy.com/guides/configuration-management#wasm-filters). `meshplayctl filter import [file | URL] --wasm-config [filepath|string]`
