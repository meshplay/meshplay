Meshplay uses a combination of techniques to generate models for capabilities defined in its [Registry]({{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/registry). The following are the primary techniques used:

- **Static Models:** Pre-defined models included with each Meshplay release. See the full list of static models.
- **Dynamic Models:** Generated at run-time by connecting Meshplay to supported platforms like Kubernetes clusters or cloud providers.

<h4>Importing Models into the Registry using Meshplay CLI</h4>
<p>To register a model using the Meshplay CLI, you can use the meshplayctl command to import a model from a specified path:</p>

<pre><code>meshplayctl model import -f &lt;path-to-model&gt; </code></pre>
<h4>Using Meshplay UI</h4>
<p>You can also register a model through the Meshplay UI:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate to the Settings â†’ Registry page.</li>
    <li>Click the "Import" button.</li>
    <li>Select the model you want to import.</li>
</ul>
