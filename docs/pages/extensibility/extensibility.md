Meshplay has an extensible architecture with several different types of extension points.

 <!-- via [adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/adapters), different [load generators]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/load-generators) and different [providers]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/providers). Meshplay also offers a REST API. -->

## Extension Points

Meshplay is not just an application. It is a set of microservices where the central component is itself called Meshplay. Integrators may extend Meshplay by taking advantage of designated Extension Points. Extension points come in various forms and are available through Meshplayâ€™s architecture.

## Types of Extension Points

The following points of extension are currently incorporated into Meshplay.

{% assign sorted = site.pages | sort: "extensibility" %}

<ul>
    {% for item in sorted %}
    {% if item.type=="Extensibility" and item.list!="exclude" and item.language !="es"  -%}
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a>
      {% if item.abstract != " " %}
              - {{ item.abstract }}
            {% endif %}
            </li>
            {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
