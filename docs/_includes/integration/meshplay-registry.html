<h2>What is the Meshplay Registry</h2>

The Meshplay Registry is a vital component within Meshplay, serving as a centralized repository for managing a diverse range of cloud and cloud native resources. It stores and organizes crucial information such as models, categories, components, and relationships, enabling efficient interaction and utilization of these resources within the Meshplay ecosystem. You can conveniently access and manage registry data through Meshplay UI, and through Meshplay CLI (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reference/meshplayctl/#meshplay-registry-management">meshplayctl registry</a>).
